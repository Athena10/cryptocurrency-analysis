## About

Having followed the cryptocurrency market for a while now, I decided to do some exploring in the data available from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com).
Especially in light of the increasing number of successful coins and [decreasing Bitcoin dominance in terms of market capitalisation](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage), I assume many investors are eager to understand the dynamics in this market.

## Progress

*Data updated 29/08/2017. Restricted some visualizations to data from 2017*

This is a work in progress. Steps taken so far:

1. Obtain and clean data from [coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com) using [coinmarketcap-scraper](https://github.com/prouast/coinmarketcap-scraper). This gives us daily closing prices for each coin.

2. Calculate **Overall market capitalisation** and **Herfindahl index** to illustrate the change in market capitalisation and competition between coins.

	> The Herfindahl index measures competition in a market by summing the squares of all competitor market shares. It ranges from 1/N (highly competitive) to 1 (high concentration), where N is the number of competitors. [More information.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl_index)

	- Here, we see that both market capitalisation and competition are increasing over time. Since the recent correction, the decrease in concentration has stagnated.

3. Calculate the **daily return** for each coin.

	> The rate of return is the income from an investment expressed as a proportion of the original investment. Hence, here it is `(price(t) - price(t-1)) / price(t-1)`. [More information.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return)

	- Using this data, we can plot the daily returns for arbitrary coins on a time axis. Example: **Comparing returns for bitcoin, ethereum and ripple**

	- This also allows us to investigate the correlations between the daily returns of arbitrary coins. Example: **Plotting bitcoin vs ethereum returns**. Here, every point represents one day. *Note that this plot is based on data from 2017 only.*

		> Correlation measures the linear relationship between two sets of data. A high value when comparing the daily returns of two coins indicates a positive linear relationship of the returns in the past.

	- Finally, we can look at pairwise correlations between all coins: **Visualisation of the correlation matrix for top 25 cryptocurrencies**. *Note that this plot is based on data from 2017 only.*

		> The (symmetric) correlation matrix visualises the correlation for each pair of variables - from perfect positive linear relationship (blue) to perfect negative linear relationship (red).

4. Calculate overall **market returns** using daily values for overall market capitalisation.
   This series is initially dominated by bitcoin, with more altcoin influence as their market capitalisations increase.

	- Corresponding to the first plot, we can now give a plot of the overall **Market return** across time:

	- Similarly, we can investigate the correlation of arbitrary coins with the market return. Example: **Plotting ethereum vs market return**. *Note that this plot is based on data from 2017 only.*

5. Calculate coin `beta` to characterise the behaviour of each coin return with respect to the market return.

	- Beta represents the covariance of coin returns and market returns, scaled by the variance of the market returns.
	  See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model) for more information.

		> Investors use the information encoded in the beta coefficient to characterise an asset's volatility and tendency to move in accordance with the market index. `beta = 1` indicates that the asset moves exactly like the market index. [More information.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)) Here, the market is dominated by bitcoin, hence bitcoin's beta is very close to 1 and a coin's beta can also be interpreted as a comparison to bitcoin's movement.

	- Here, we plot coin betas against market capitalisations for the top 20 coins in terms of market capitalisation. *Note that this plot is based on data from 2017 only.*
